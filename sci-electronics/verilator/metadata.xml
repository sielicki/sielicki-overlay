		Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator, and beats most
		commercial simulators. It compiles synthesizable Verilog (not test-bench
		code!), plus some PSL, SystemVerilog and Synthesis assertions into C++
		or SystemC code. It is designed for large projects where fast simulation
		performance is of primary concern, and is especially well suited to
		generate executable models of CPUs for embedded software design teams.
